# Puppy-Shelter-Scraper
At one point I was looking to get a puppy from the shelter. Within a couple of hours of a new post on puppies they were already taken. To solve this issue I made Puppy-Shelter-Scraper. It scrapes the shelter's website looking for post of new puppies. If it finds some it emails me an alert.
